    """Radar capture system with a mmWave Radar and DCA1000EVM.

    This high-level API provides three different ways to read frames, each
    with different performance characteristics:

    - [`stream`][.]: a simple iterator which yields successive frames. No
        buffering is done, which may lead to dropped packets if the consumer
        is too slow.
    - [`qstream`][.]: a queue-based interface, where a separate thread reads
        frames into a queue. This prevents dropped packets, but may lead to
        unbounded latency if the consumer is too slow.
    - [`dstream`][.]: a "drop frame" iterator, which yields the most recent
        frame, dropping any frames received while the consumer is processing a
        frame.

    These correspond to the following use cases:

    | Method | Use case | Performance characteristics |
    |---|---|---|
    | [`stream`][.] | Debugging, user-managed real-time systems | No buffering |
    | [`qstream`][.] | Data collection | No dropped packets, but unbounded latency |
    | [`dstream`][.] | Real-time demos | No dropped packets, but may drop frames |

    !!! info "Known Constraints"

        The `XWRSystem` will check for known constraints on initialization,
        and warn or raise if any are violated. See
        [`xwr.constraints`][xwr.constraints] for the full list.

    Type Parameters:
        - `TRadar`: radar type (subclass of [`XWRBase`][xwr.radar.])

    Args:
        radar: radar configuration; if `dict`, the key/value pairs are passed
            to `XWRConfig`.
        capture: capture card configuration; if `dict`, the key/value pairs are
            passed to `DCAConfig`.
        name: friendly name for logging; can be default.
        strict: if `True`, raise an error instead of logging a warning if the
            radar configuration contains potentially invalid values.
